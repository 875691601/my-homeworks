# my-homeworks
Here are codes of some course designs
### how to download a single file
I'll illustrate how to download a single file instead of the whole repository step by step, take 
[my-homeworks/pattern-recognize](https://github.com/strawcat/my-homeworks/tree/master/pattern-recognize) for instance,
how to downlaod the file **hw4** ?

1. Open ./hw4 and get its url: https://github.com/strawcat/my-homeworks/tree/master/pattern-recognize/hw4
2. Replace **/tree/master/** with **/trunk/**, now we get https://github.com/strawcat/my-homeworks/trunk/pattern-recognize/hw4
3. Input this line in the terminal: `svn checkout https://github.com/strawcat/my-homeworks/trunk/pattern-recognize/hw4`
4. You may recieve warning says that "The certificate is not issued by a trusted authority. Use the
   fingerprint to validate the certificate manually!", input `P/p` for "accept permanently", and press **Enter**
   
5. Done!
